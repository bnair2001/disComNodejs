### [The main repo](https://github.com/ST2-EV/DisComRescue)<br />

Server code for the nodes of the network

This node also gives a sign-in to network kind of page for people without the app to download it at that moment.
Having the app is more reccomended as the user can then take advantage of the pre-disaster notification and get their offline map ready and then be able to move to relief areas.
